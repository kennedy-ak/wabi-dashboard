CATEGORY_CLASSIFICATION_PROMPT_TEXT_BASED ="""
**Furniture Category Classification System**

**Task**: Analyze furniture product details and return a structured JSON prediction of its category, style, and placement using the following rules.

**Input Requirements**:
- `product_name` (string)
- `tags` (comma-separated string)
- `style` (string, optional)
- `suggested_placement` (string, optional)

**Processing Rules**:

1. **Category Prediction** (Priority: Name > Tags):
   - SOFA: Contains "sofa"/"couch"/"sectional" + tags like "upholstered"/"L-shaped"
   - CHAIR: Contains "chair"/"armchair" + tags like "velvet"/"swivel"
   - BED: Contains "bed"/"headboard" + tags like "platform"/"floating"
   - TABLE: Contains "table"/"desk" + tags like "dining"/"pedestal"
   - NIGHTSTAND: Contains "nightstand"/"bedside" + tags like "drawer"/"storage"
   - STOOL: Contains "stool" + tags like "accent"/"footrest"
   - STORAGE: Contains "dresser"/"wardrobe"/"cabinet"/"bookcase" + tags like "storage"/"drawers"
   - DESK: Contains "desk"/"office desk"/"writing desk" + tags like "computer"/"study"
   - BENCH: Contains "bench" + tags like "dining"/"entryway"/"storage"
   - OTTOMAN: Contains "ottoman"/"footstool"/"pouf" + tags like "upholstered"/"accent"
   - LIGHTING: Contains "lamp"/"light"/"chandelier"/"pendant" + tags like "floor"/"table"
   - DECOR: Contains "decorative"/"artwork"/"mirror"/"plant" + tags like "accent"/"wall"
   - VASE: Contains "vase"/"bottle" + tags like "ceramic"/"glass"/"decorative"
   - TV_STAND: Contains "tv stand"/"entertainment"/"media console" + tags like "storage"/"stand"
   - PAINTINGS: Contains "painting"/"art"/"print"/"canvas" + tags like "wall"/"framed"
   - OTHER: Items that don't match above categories

2. **Style Extraction**:
   - Split `style` by "/" or ","
   - First term → `primary_style`
   - Second term → `secondary_style` (if exists)
   - Style tags: Filter tags related to aesthetics (e.g., "minimalist", "boucle")

3. **Placement Tags**:
   - Split `suggested_placement` by "/" or ","
   - Convert to lowercase (e.g., "Living Room" → "living room")
   - Remove generic terms ("general", "multipurpose")

4. **Confidence Scoring**:
   - 0.9-1.0: Exact name/tag match
   - 0.7-0.89: Name matches but tags ambiguous
   - 0.5-0.69: Partial match only
   - <0.5: Flag for review

**Output Format**:
```json
{
    "product_name": "string",
    "category": "SOFA/CHAIR/BED/etc.",
    "primary_style": "string|null",
    "secondary_style": "string|null",
    "style_tags": ["string"],
    "placement_tags": ["string"],
    "confidence": float,
    "reasoning": "string"
}
Examples:

Input:

product_name: "Joss & Main Fleetwood 100''  SOFA"

tags: "large size, minimalist, neutral palette"

style: "Modern"

suggested_placement: "Living Room"

Output:

json
{
    "product_name": "Joss & Main Fleetwood 100'' Sofa",
    "category": "SOFA",
    "primary_style": "Modern",
    "secondary_style": null,
    "style_tags": ["minimalist"],
    "placement_tags": ["living room"],
    "confidence": 0.98,
    "reasoning": "Product name contains 'sofa' and tags ('large size') support SOFA classification. Style is explicitly Modern."
}
Input (Ambiguous Case):

product_name: "Storage Bench"

tags: "bench, cabinet, drawers"

style: "Japandi"

suggested_placement: "Bedroom"

Output:

json
{
    "product_name": "Storage Bench",
    "category": "BENCH",
    "primary_style": "Japandi",
    "secondary_style": null,
    "style_tags": [],
    "placement_tags": ["bedroom"],
    "confidence": 0.75,
    "reasoning": "Name contains 'bench' but tags suggest storage functionality. Defaulting to BENCH as primary category."
}
Edge Case Handling:

Conflicting terms: "Sofa Table" → Prefer TABLE if tags include "dining"/"coffee"

Missing data: Null values for optional fields

Low confidence: Flag in reasoning (e.g., "Low confidence due to ambiguous tags")

Required Compliance:

Always validate against allowed categories: ["SOFA", "CHAIR", "BED", "TABLE", "NIGHTSTAND", "STOOL", "STORAGE", "DESK", "BENCH", "OTTOMAN", "LIGHTING", "DECOR", "VASE", "TV_STAND", "PAINTINGS", "OTHER"]

Never invent new categories

Arrays must contain at least one item or be empty []

### Key Features:
1. **Rule-Based Clarity**: Explicit priority (name > tags) minimizes ambiguity.
2. **Style/Placement Processing**: Handles split terms and normalization.
3. **Confidence Scoring**: Transparent metrics for reliability.
4. **Error Resilience**: Edge cases are flagged in reasoning.
5. **Structured Output**: Matches your exact JSON schema.

To implement:
1. Parse input fields.
2. Apply rules sequentially (name → tags → style/placement).
3. Calculate confidence based on rule matches.
4. Return the JSON with explanations.
